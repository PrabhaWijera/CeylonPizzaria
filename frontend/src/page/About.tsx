                        <strong>Ceylon Pizzaria ! üçï</strong> Pizza is a culinary
                        marvel in its own league, and rightfully so. It represents
                        the epitome of flavor and satisfaction, offering a guilt-free
                        and irresistibly delicious experience with our carefully
                        crafted hand-kneaded crust. The secret lies in the 80% hydration
                        of our proprietary special blend of Italian flour, delivering a
                        crisp, light, easy-to-digest, healthier, and more delectable base!

                        At Ceylon Pizzaria,
                        we are on a mission to introduce our uniquely healthy yet
                        undeniably tasty menu to a community of thinkers, doers,
                        movers, shakers, and life enthusiasts. Founded in December
                        2023 as a Prabhas's concept,  our founders, <strong className="font-semibold hover:text-blue-400"> 
                        Prabhash Wijerathna
                           </strong> 
                         , dedicated countless hours to perfecting our signature
                        30-hour-fermented base, after extensive research and taste
                        testing in Rome.

                        We take pride in sourcing the finest ingredients,
                        from the best-cured meats like our bresaola and beef
                        spianata picante to authentic Italian tomatoes and
                        cheeses. Our mozzarella is locally produced by skilled
                        Italian craftsmen, and we prioritize locally sourced,
                        GMO-free vegetables and herbs for our toppings.
                        Since our humble beginnings
                        in Business Bay, Srilanka, in 2023,
                        Ceylon Pizzaria has successfully
                        expanded to six additional locations
                        across the Western, with a presence
                        in neighboring Southern. Between 2023 April
                        and 2023, we also operated two stores
                        in USA, UK. In 2024 , we extended
                        our reach to the Middle East, introducing
                        pop-up locations in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
                        operating for a 12-month duration.
